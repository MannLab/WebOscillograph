# WebOscillograph

## Setup:
To make proper use of this, you need a "blackground" (completely black background),
so use the Firefox add on that hides scrollbars, and then use fullscreen setting (F11).
Here's the firefox add on:

Install : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/hide-scrollbars/

## Howto run:
`firefox chirps.html`

## Authors:

a cathode ray oscillograph.
